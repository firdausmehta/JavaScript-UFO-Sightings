## Overview:
Write code using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js, that will create a table dynamically based upon a UFO sightings dataset. The code will allow users to filter the table data for specific values.

## Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js)

## Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a HTML web page

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
